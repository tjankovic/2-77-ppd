This directory contains scans from my design notebook for 2.77 Fundamentals of Precision Product Design.

# Notebook Volumes
The first notebook included in this documentation scheme is an A4 Rhodia side staple-bound book with lined sheets. This volume is designated volume A. Subsequent volumes should be designated with capital letters in alphabetical order.

Subsequent volumes should ideally be of similar form factor. In keeping with the philosophy of "the best design notebook is the one you have with you", lightweight and portable notebooks with fewer than 50 leaves (100 pages) should be used. This page limit is enforced in the naming scheme for files.

# Scan Parameters
Optical parameters such as brightness and contrast should be adjusted to maximize legibility. Scans should be in full color with a minimum resolution of 300 dpi. Files should be saved as JPEG images.

# Naming Scheme
Filenames should conform to the following structure:

	> X_NN_<suffix>.jpg

X is the volume designation (A, B, C...). NN is the 2-digit page number (01, 02,..., 99). The suffix should be used to reflect additional information for special files. Specific cases are listed below. This list should be updated to reflect new cases when they are added to handle special cases:

-"a<n>": this denotes additional pages that are affixed to page NN by staples, glue, or other means. <n> should be substituted for a single-digit number unique to each page attached. Scan parameters similar to those used for pages are applicable to attachments, with the exception that the scan should be sized according to the true size of attached pages.
